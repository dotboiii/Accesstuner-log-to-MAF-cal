# Accesstuner-log-to-MAF-cal

| USE THIS SOFTWARE AT YOUR OWN RISK, YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR TUNING / MODIFYING YOUR OWN CAR! |


TLDR import a MAF calibration log recorded by accesstuner studio or a accessport, the software then tries to create a calibration for you.
It will most likely still take multiple revisions to get a final calibration in your tune. Make manual adjustments as needed.
Please double check the calibration before running it! Your results can and will vary slightly depending on the quality of your log file entered.


This is currently only tested for Mazdaspeed3 and Mazdaspeed6 Vechiles, other vehicles are not currently supported but may still work.
I would need a bunch of maf cal logs from various cars of the same model to implement it, feel free to submit your own below:


If you would like to help contribute to future development of this software, feel free to send me MAF calibraion logs from any vehicle so long as its:
A: recorded using a Cobb accessport
B: recorded using accesstuner studio.
Please email me list the year, make, model, engine, and modifications to the vehicle to o.max.madden@gmail.com

If you encounter any bugs in the software refrain from emailing me and create an issue in gibhub insetad.
