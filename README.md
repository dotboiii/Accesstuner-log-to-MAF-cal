# Accesstuner-log-to-MAF-cal
This tool is currently a work in progress and is provided "AS IS". It is not intended for public use, and instructions will not be provided until further development.

In a nutshell, this software is designed to calibrate a Mass Airflow Sensor for vehicles by attempting to reduce Fuel Trim values to zero. This should lead to a vehicle that runs more efficiently, accelerates better, and increases longevity of the engine by having the correct amount of airflow for a given amount of fuel.

This projects current development has moved here using Rust: https://github.com/lord-xld3/accesstuner_logger
